# js-webgl-2d-polygon-interpolator
Webpage made for the Computer Graphics class throught the Strictu Sensu Master's Degree at the Universidade Federal Fluminense.

In this webpage, one can see the interpolation between two 2d shapes, defined through vertices and edges.
One may control the speed the frames run on the screen as well.

TO DO:
 - Make the vertex correspondence distance-based (as opposed to a perfect match between vertices from both shapes)
 - Employ an alternative interpolation method
